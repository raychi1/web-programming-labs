      <br />Fairy<br />
      Over hill, over dale,<br />
      Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br />
      Over park, over pale,<br />
      Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br />
      I do wander everywhere,<br />
      Swifter than the moon's sphere;<br />
      And I serve the fairy queen,<br />
      To dew her orbs upon the green.<br />
      The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<br />
      In their gold coats spots you see;<br />
      Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br />
      In those freckles live their savours:<br />
      I must go seek some dewdrops here<br />
      And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.<br />
      Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:<br />
      Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
    </p>
    <p class="italic">
      <br />PUCK<br />
      The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<br />
      Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br />
      For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br />
      Because that she as her attendant hath<br />
      A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br />
      She never had so sweet a changeling;<br />
      And jealous Oberon would have the child<br />
      Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br />
      But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br />
      Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br />
      And now they never meet in grove or green,<br />
      By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br />
      But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br />
      Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
